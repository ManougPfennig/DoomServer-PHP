# DOOM SERVER - PHP
### 1. Sounds metal, right ?

Well, really it's nothing more than a **web application made to walk around a 3D multiplayer map**.

The term 'Doom' is there because the **frontend uses a rendering technique called ray-casting**, which first saw the light in the video-game industry in the 1990's to make some of the **first ever 3D video-games** like **Wolfenstein3D** or, like the name suggests, **Doom**.

Maybe you expected an actual *Doom Server* made to take over the world ? ~I wish~ Don't trust me, it's still a lot of fun.
